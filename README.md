# Context Engineering for GitHub Copilot

This repo contains bootstrapping assets and tools for making tools. This is a personal collection of the custom instructions, agents, prompts, and scripts I use to configure GitHub Copilot for my projects. The meta-tooling and bootstrapping tools for Copilot customization is still maturing across the industry, so this repo fills gaps that will soon be covered by better tooling.

There is no attempt to make the assets in this repo generally useful; they are things I use for configuring repos that use Copilot. I use this repo to share links to these assets as examples in disucssions with teammates, and to serve as a starting place for bootstrapping Copilot in my work repos. Sometimes I put things here that I developed in another repo and I want to reuse in other repos.

I use [Spec Kit](https://github.com/github/spec-kit) for some of the work in this repo, so you will see those prompts and agents mixed with the Copilot meta-tooling.

## What's included

### Reusable instructions

Drop-in instruction files that shape Copilot's behavior for specific file types. Each file uses `applyTo` patterns so they activate automatically. See the [instructions folder](.github/instructions/).

For a broader collection of community-maintained instructions, see [Awesome Copilot](https://github.com/github/awesome-copilot).

### Custom agents

Specialized AI personas with defined expertise, tool access, and behavioral guidelines. See the [agents folder](.github/agents/).

Notable: the [Agent Creator](.github/agents/cp.agent-creator.agent.md) is a meta-agent — an agent for building new Copilot custom agents.

### Prompt files

Reusable slash-command prompts that orchestrate multi-step workflows. See the [prompts folder](.github/prompts/).

### Custom skills

Reusable skill definitions that give agents domain-specific capabilities for multi-step workflows. See the [skills folder](.github/skills/).

### Scripts

Shell scripts that rely on Copilot for part of their functionality. See the [scripts folder](scripts/).

### Agent plugin

A distributable [agent plugin](.github/plugin/) that bundles the custom agents and skills from this repo into a single installable package for VS Code and GitHub Copilot CLI.

### Context engineering materials

Notes on context engineering and presentation slides in the [docs folder](docs/).
